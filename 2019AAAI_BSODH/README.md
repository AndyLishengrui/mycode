# Towards Optimal Discrete Online Hashing with Balanced Similarity

This code is for our AAAI2019 paper, i.e., <a href ="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10185">Towards Optimal Discrete Online Hashing with Balanced Similarity</a>.

The current code is kind of messy since I haven't got enough time to re-write it.

I share this code right now for the multiple requests I have received.

I'll spare some time to update it as soon as possible and more details about the hyper-parameters will be given soon.

Any question, please feel free to contact me: lmbxmu@stu.xmu.edu.cn
